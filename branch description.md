This branch is assigned to Tam Nguyen, and he is working on the "Breakout" minigame.
This is an arcade game, where player has a paddle and a ball. The ultimate mission is to break all the bricks. 

Just finished drawing step, now working on game mechanism (Collision, Bouncing Angle)

Future plan: Add score counter, restart button.
